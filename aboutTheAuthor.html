            Hello everyone,

            thanks again for visiting my site. My name is Ryan Cosner and I'm a 20 year old who's still as fascinated by the wonders of science as I was when I was 5. I'm originally from Manhattan Beach, California, near Los Angeles, but am currently a 3rd year Mechanical Engineer at UC, Berkeley.

            &nbsp;
            As a kid, I always found myself puzzling through daily life, trying to fit pieces together and figure out how everything works. I was always taking things apart, searching on websites like <a href="http://www.howstuffworks.com/">HowStuffWorks.com</a>, and incessantly asking my parents an undending series of "how does that work?". That interest led me to pursue a study of physics and engineering to help me understand every aspect of the world around me.
            <br>
            &nbsp;
            &nbsp;
            &nbsp;
            &nbsp;
            &nbsp;
            Once I had gained a significant enough uderstanding of how things works, I started to use that knowledge to my advantage, using science and physics as tools to help me build my own projects. Through doing so, I've also found an interest in research; having always loved to understand the "how" of natural phenonmena, I find it even more exhilerating to explore topics that have never been explored before, to break scientific ground, and actually change our understanding of concepts, even in the slightest bit.

            &nbsp;
            Overall, I absolutely see myself as a "Maker". I chose to study engineering instead of Physics or any other hard science <i> because </i> engineering has a hands-on component. Not only are you learnign the rules of nature in a predictive capacity, but you're also using those rules and bending them to work in your favor (almost like the Matrix), using natural phenomena to create something otherwordly. I'm absolutely an engineer who likes to get his hands dirty working in the garage or in the lab, watching my designs, code, or calculations come to life and interact with the real world.

            &nbsp;
            &nbsp;
            Beyond engineering, I've also been inspired by a number of other pursuits. Particularly, I have a passion for music and long distance sports, particularly traithlon. To me music serves as another language, a language of emotions rather than logic and I love being able to connect with those feelings and empathetically share those feelings between myself and the artist or between myself and others. Also, I love long distance sports for the team's comradery, for the zen that they help achieve, and for the steadfast dedication that they teach. I'm currently part of UC, Berkeley's triathlon team and I really enjoy the team environment and being able to calm my mind in a long run or bike exploring the Berkeley hills. Also, the sport has taught me to push for new heights, showing me that everything is possible as long as you're willing to put in, as Coach Dean Harper would say, "hard work over time".

            So, that's a little bit about myself. I hope that you enjoyed reading and that you enjoy looking through these projects as much as I enjoyed making them. Also, if you'd like to reach out to me or if you're trying to build a project similar to one of mine and are looking for advice, don't be afraid to reach out. My contact info is at the bottom of every page. Again thanks for visiting and enjoying browsing through these pages.

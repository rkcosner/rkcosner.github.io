            I spent the summer of 2016 and spring of 2017 researching with the 
            <a href="http://taflab.berkeley.edu/">TAF Lab
            </a>
            (the Theoretical and Applied Fluid Dynamics Laboratory) at UC, Berkeley as part of the 
            <a href="http://calwave.org/"> 
                CalWave Power Technologies
            </a>
            group.

            In the summer of 2016, I worked on a variety of project: helping the team prepare their Wave Energy Converter for for the US Department of Engery's Wave Energy Prize Challenge. In order to do that, I tested things such as spring constants and moments of inertia of various components, and also helping to design, build, and manufacture the adjustable mooring system.

            I then took a semester off of research, to focus more heavily on academics and other extracurriculars, and then came back in the Spring of 2017
        </p>
        <p class="article">
            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
            In that semester, the group and I focused on the Wave Energy Convert and its response to hazardous conditions. Generally, the device could handle everyday weather conditions, but in the case of extreme conditions, such as storms, it could result in excessive loads which could severly damage the device. Therefore, my group and I set out to determine how best to shed load from a Wave Energy Converter during a storm.

            We used the Buckingham Pi Theory to scale our experiment down and perform rigorous tests in the TAFLab's wave generating tank. The experiments had very interesting results and we were able to begin to determine the pressure curve created by a wave rolling over a rigid platform, this was incredibly fascinating and something that we believe had never been fully research before.

                The idea for this website spawned from two things: the first being that I really wanted to develop a better understanding of the internet in terms of what it really is and hows to interface with it and also because I wanted ot have a log of all of the projects that I've worked on in the past, both for nostalgic purposes as well as to show people my accomplishments in the form of a "Maker's Portfolio". I've definitely made significant leaps in my understanding of the internet and computers in general and I've also become very pleased with this site as a Maker's Portfolio and very much enjoy nostalgically scrolling through and remembering my old projects.

                &nbsp;
                &nbsp;
                Initially, I began by teaching myself three computer languages: html (Hyper Text Markup Language), css (Cascading Style Script), and JavaScript using the website: 
                <a href="https://www.codecademy.com/learn">
                    Code Academy
                </a>
                , these text books: 
                <a href="https://drive.google.com/uc?id=0B_I3BR7HVLyhUk9kU3k0bndtWkU.">
                    HTML5 & CSS3
                </a>
                and
                <a href="https://drive.google.com/uc?id=0B_I3BR7HVLyhMEdQZi1fZFRUX0U">
                    The Web Book
                </a>
                , and also lots of well defined googling, especially on
                <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/">
                    Stack Overflow
                </a>
                .
                Then, through lots of trial and error and rereading, I wrote all of the code for this site from scratch. In order to actively view changes and edits I used an Open Source text editor and web-developer program called 
                <a href="http://brackets.io/">
                    Brackets
                </a>
                .
                
                <br>
                &nbsp;
                &nbsp;
                &nbsp;
                &nbsp;
                &nbsp;
                Once I got the basics of this all set I used instructions on this website (
                <a href="http://blog.teamtreehouse.com/deploy-static-site-heroku"> How to Deploy a Static Site on Heroku</a>) instructions to deploy my code onto Heroku's hosting servers.
                After that, I purchased my own domain name through 
                <a href="https://www.namecheap.com/">
                    NameCheap
                </a>
                and connected the two; thus giving the site a personalized and more profesional domain name.
                <br>
                &nbsp;
                &nbsp;
                &nbsp;
                &nbsp;
                &nbsp;
                Since initially deployment was successful, I've spent a significant amount of time developing content for the website as well as editing aesthetic components to make it more appealing and professional in appearance. As the website continues to improve I look to add more active JavaScript features and also edit the code so as to make all of the content reponsive to mobile or tablet devices. Also, due to the slow speed of Heroku's free hosting and it's lack of google-searchability, I'm considering attempting to host the website myself in the future, possibly using my Raspberry Pi or a dedicated inexpensive desktop that someone else might be throwing away.

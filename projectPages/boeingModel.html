            While working as an intern at the Boeing Company in the Satellite Design Center, I had three main tasks: conducting research on the Thermal Properties of Carbon Nanotubes, mapping geosynchronous satellites, and creating a device to help with preliminary layout and design.

            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
            I, along with two other interns, developed a magnetic, tactile lay-up tool to help design Boeing's satellite payloads. This tool featured two-dimensional CAD-based drawings of all of the main satellite components and the generalized payload layout. The components could be layed on the payload and arranged to help quickly show tolerancing problems and dimensional restrictions.

            This project, along with the other things that I worked on over the summer won the "Best Summer Project" award from amongst the approximately 50 interns that worked at Boeing in El Segundo that summer. Furthermore, it was put into use immediately after the internship ended in 2014 and became a useful tool in preliminary design for the Satellite Design Center.

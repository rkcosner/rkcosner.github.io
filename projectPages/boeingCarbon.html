            Over the Summer of 2014, I worked as an intern at the Boeing Company in their Satellite Design Center. I had a variety of tasks over the summer, but one of them in particular was to run research experiments to determine some of the thermal and emissive properties of Carbon Nanotubes which would determine their usefulness in a variety of aerospace applications.

            At the time, I was a junior in high school and had no experience with material properties, the science behind heat transfer, or with research techniques, but I went to work learning about each one and put them to use to understand, develop, and execute a variety of these tests. The data from which, although unfortunately proprietary, was uploaded to the general Boeing database for any employee to draw from and use for their work.

            This project also won the award of "Best Summer Project" from amongst the other ~50 interns working during the same summer.

            As part of UC, Berkeley's E27 "Manufacturing and Tolerancing" class, a group of 5 other engineers and I were tasked with designing a bridge which could be manufactured using only a 3D printer and PLA filament, could span a 10 in gap, relied only vertical frictional support only without any normal-force support, and which havd as high of a load-supported/weight ratio as possible. The official rules for the project can be found in the classes project .pdf here:

            The bridge had to be supported by the following base using only vertical frictional forces on the vertical aluminum rods.

            Eventually my group and I designed and developed our 5 part bridge which used dove-tail joints to connect the center and truss pieces and "negative feedback"-based connectors to increase the friction on the bars as the load increased. Furthermore, a large amount of care was taken to make sure that the tolerancing for every part of the bridge was within a reasonable amount to make sure that all of our press-fit parts fit together with little slack. This took a large amount of time to perfect the designs in regards to the inherent dimensional error in 3d Printing.

            Throughout the semester, various iterations of the bridge were designed and printed, in large part due to complications with the 3D printers. Our initial design for a 1 part bridge was scrapped and turned into a 5 part bridge to reduce printing time and the likelihood of errors, also the majority of the GDT was edited to allow the bridge to fit better. Finally, we also changed the design from pure press-fit to include vertically placed wedges which acted to increase fricitonal grip proportionally to downward force. The first handful of iterations of the bridge can be seen in the group's initial report here:

            At the end of the semester, all of the projects were fail-tested and our bridge managed to support ~350 pounds which ranked it as second best in the class, a large margin above all of the other groups except for one.

            This project also tangentially taught us teamwork and workspace dynamics. I quickly discovered that I was willing to put more work into the project than the others and had a higher expectation for the final result. This led me to step up to take on a leadership role in the class and in the project. I worked to involve everyone and managed to create a project which I was happy with and in which every member of the team played a part.

            Ultimately, because of the success of our project, my leadership of the team, and my success in this and other design classes, I won the <a href="https://www.me.berkeley.edu/undergraduate/resources/awards-and-scholarships">
            Alexander & Ethel Levens Mechanical Engineering Award
            </a>
            for excellence in the undergraduate design classes.

                In Spring 2017 I took UC, Berkeley's ME106: Fluid Mechanics course with Professor Shawn Shadden. I was not only fascinated by the course material, but also incredibly interested because the Professor made the class especially interesting through the use of applicable, hands-on project. These projects, described below, helped to give me an even better understaning of fluid mechanics from a practical and real-world perspective.

                        For this project, the class was tasked with performing a CFD (Computational Fluid Dynamics) analysis using the FEA (Finite Element Analysis) software: Ansys Fluent. The project involved very specific intructions regarding measuring the drag forces in 2-Dimensional flow around a cylinder given very specific boundary conditions and the analytical portion of the project was relating how our model compared to real-life values and explaining any descrepancies between the two.

                        In project 2, we were tasked with creating a computer program which would take an Eurlerian velocity field (constant position) of a given area of fluid and model the Lagrangian flow (following fluid particles) of various particles. The full description of this project can be found here:

                        This project was particularly entertaining becaus it was very open ended and the Professor suggested that, if we had time, we should not only make it scientifically accurate, but also make it entertaining.

                        My project partner and I decided to take an Eulerian set of data regarding a gust of wind and follow fluid particles within that. In order to do that, we used Euler's method to approximate the second derivative of the particles at a given position and used that to determine their velocity and movement through the fluid. To make it interesting and entertaining, we made the program like a video game where you use the gust of wind to throw a baseball. The data and MatLab code can be found here:

                        Also, for people who might not have MatLab to run the sript, here is an example run of what our program did:

                        This was the first project undertaken by the class and was given to use at the beginning of the semester when we did not have that much experience with fluids and had not had a chance ot learn much in the class. Therefore, this project was mostly to spark our imaginations and whet our interests. It involved us taking a picture of a fluid's phenomenon and attempting to explain it, with emphasis given to the artistic nature of the photo in order to highlight the natural beauty and complexity of fluid mechanics. The inspiration for this project was largely taken from this fluids website and the associated course:
                        <a href="http://www.flowvis.org/">
                            www.flowvis.org
                        </a>
                        <br>
                        &nbsp;
                        &nbsp;
                        &nbsp;
                        &nbsp;
                        &nbsp;
                        For  this project, my partner and I experimented with a large number of fluid properties including bubles, high viscosity, non-newtonian characteristics, and worthington jets, amongst others, before finally settling on dry-ice and the Leidenfrost-type interaction.
                        &nbsp;

                        Our report decribes our experimental set up and our interpretation of the results. One important aspect that we discussed was that, although the images may share many visual similarities to tornados or cyclones, the physics causing the phenomenon is very different and actual has a pressure gradient in the opposite direction.

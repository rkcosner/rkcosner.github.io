                Over the summer of 2017, a friend let me borrow his DJI Phantom drone to take pictures and video when I was in Peru. While flying it I instantly realized how useful a drone like that could be for filming marching bands, helping them get a new perspective on their formations and make improvements to their shows with more accuracy. Also, I was fascinated by the technology that goes into making a drone so I wanted to attempt to build one for myself.
                <br>
                &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;
                After a good bit of Amazon surfing and a lot of research, I finally amassed all of the parts that I needed for the project and began assembling it. I eventually got it put together, but had some trouble with the CC3D flight controller running the LibrePilot flight system. Although super exciting to have the drone flying for the first time, the errors in that flight controller led me to a 4 story fall and I wound up with a broken frame.
               <br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
                After getting a new, slightly larger frame in the mail, I was back at it. This time I upgraded my firmware on my flight controller to CleanFlight and the drone flew like a dream. It was beyond satisfying (and a little terrifying) to watch the drone take off and see my creation in the air flying around with relative ease. 
                <br>
                &nbsp;
                &nbsp;
                &nbsp;
                &nbsp;
                &nbsp;
                Now that I've gotten off the ground and can control the drone with relative accuracy, the next step is to start making it useful. I'm currently in the process of attaching a camera and I'm excited to get going with some areal photography!

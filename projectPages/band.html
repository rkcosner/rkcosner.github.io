            In the Spring of 2016, UC Berkeley's E7 Introduction to Computer Programming for Engineers, the class was tasked with developing an algorithm to aid the marching band in planning their on-field performances.

            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
            In particular, the band needed a way to traverse from one formation to another within a certain number of beats without any collisions between bandsmen. The class then had to develop a program which would take the beginning and ending formations as inputs and plan a route for each bandsman. 
        </p>
        <p class="article">
            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
            This problem was particularly interesting to me because, as a member of the marching band, I knew how useful this kind of program could be, reducing the time which is required to plan shows which had previously taken a team of 6 several days for every football game.

            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
            Eventually, the rest of the class and I were able to develop a variety fo solutions which were then given to the band and are currently in use to help improve our process in designing shows.

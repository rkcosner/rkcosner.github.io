I worked as a Campus Ambassador for UC Berkeley's Visitor and Parent Services from 2016-2019 and as a lab tour guide with Caltech's Center for Teaching, Learning, and Outreach since 2022. 

Through my work tour guiding, I've had the opportunity to interact with people all over the world, demystify and humanize higher education, and provide actionable information regarding accessibility programs. 

Selected thank you's: 
- In working with Caltech's Center for Teaching, Learning, and Outreach, I have had the privilege of interacting with Douglas Varela and his "DaVinci Camp", a summer program for secondary students, meant to promote STEM education amongst the latinx community. Here are some of the thank yous that they've sent us: [year 1](/assets/files/thank_yous/davinci_thank_yous1.pdf), [year 2](/assets/files/thank_yous/davinci_thank_yous2.pdf).

- I was deeply honored when I received an email from this student's parent mentioning how they enjoyed my tour and how some of what I said had been very impactful and had inspired their daughter's graduation speech. The particular quote was something along the lines of "when planning your 18 unit schedule, remember to leave 4 units for life and 2 units for laundry", a joke that I would often make to remind students to have work life balance and that a large part of their first months of undergrad would be about learning to be independent, forming friendships, and experience adulthood. I am deeply honored that those words inspired this speech and I hope that it helped remind students to enter college with curiousity, openness, and excitement.

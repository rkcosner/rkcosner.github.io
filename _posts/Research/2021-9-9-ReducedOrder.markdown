**Abstract**: 

<p align="justify">
This paper presents a framework for the safety-critical control of robotic systems, when safety is defined on safe regions in the configuration space. 
To maintain safety, we synthesize a safe velocity based on control barrier function theory without relying on a -- potentially complicated -- high-fidelity dynamical model of the robot.
Then, we track the safe velocity with a tracking controller.
This culminates in "model-free safety critical control".
We prove theoretical safety guarantees for the proposed method.
Finally, we demonstrate that this approach is application-agnostic.
We execute an obstacle avoidance task with a Segway in high-fidelity simulation, as well as with a Drone and a Quadruped in hardware experiments.

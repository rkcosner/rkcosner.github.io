**Abstract**: In this paper, we introduce the notion of periodic safety, which requires that the system trajectories periodically visit a subset of a forward-invariant safe set, and utilize it in a multi-rate framework where a high-level planner generates a reference trajectory that is tracked by a low-level controller under input constraints. We introduce the notion of fixed-time barrier functions which is leveraged by the proposed low-level controller in a quadratic programming framework. Then, we design a model predictive control policy for high-level planning with a bound on the rate of change for the reference trajectory to guarantee that periodic safety is achieved. We demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed strategy on a simulation example, where the proposed fixed-time stabilizing low-level controller shows successful satisfaction of control objectives, whereas an exponentially stabilizing low-level controller fails.

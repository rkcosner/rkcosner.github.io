Wow, this one really hit home. As a mixed-race Japanese American, this book touched on feelings of otherness that have been pervasive throughout my life. It's a truly powerful story that captures love, loss, angst, and belonging in a beautiful way. 

I've been waiting a really long time to see mixed-race stories being shown on the big screen and I'm really happy to see that start to happen. It means a lot to me and will mean a lot to future generations of mixed kids.
